Hey everyone! I made this called "Password: Checker & Creator." It helps you check how strong your passwords are and also lets you generate super strong ones! You know how important it is to keep our accounts safe, right? So, I wanted to create something that makes it easy to understand password security. You just type in a password, and it tells you if it’s strong or weak. Plus, you can choose how long you want your new password to be, and it’ll create one for you that’s really secure. It's super user-friendly and looks nice, too! I think it’ll help a lot of people keep their online stuff safe!
